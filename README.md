# Physac for QB64-PE

![Logo](physac.ico)

[Physac for QB64-PE](https://github.com/a740g/Physac64) is a [QB64-PE](https://www.qb64phoenix.com/) binding library for [Physac](https://github.com/victorfisac/Physac). Physac is a small 2D physics engine written in C. The engine uses a fixed time-step thread loop to simluate physics. A physics step contains the following phases: get collision information, apply dynamics, collision solving and position correction. It uses a very simple TYPE for physic bodies with a position vector to be used in any 2D / 3D rendering API.

This version is completely standalone and does not have any [raylib-64](https://github.com/a740g/raylib-64) dependencies. As a bonus, it also contains the [reasings](https://github.com/raylib-extras/reasings) library (Robert Penner'sÂ [easing equations](https://easings.net/)) and [raymath](https://www.raylib.com/cheatsheet/raymath_cheatsheet.html) (raylib math library).

## API

The PhysicsBody TYPE contains all dynamics information and collision shape. The user may use the following structure components:

```vb
TYPE PhysicsBody
    AS _UNSIGNED LONG id ' Reference unique identifier
    AS _BYTE enabled ' Enabled dynamics state (collisions are calculated anyway)
    AS Vector2 position ' Physics body shape pivot
    AS Vector2 velocity ' Current linear velocity applied to position
    AS Vector2 force ' Current linear force (reset to 0 every step)
    AS SINGLE angularVelocity ' Current angular velocity applied to orient
    AS SINGLE torque ' Current angular force (reset to 0 every step)
    AS SINGLE orient ' Rotation in radians
    AS SINGLE inertia ' Moment of inertia
    AS SINGLE inverseInertia ' Inverse value of inertia
    AS SINGLE mass ' Physics body mass
    AS SINGLE inverseMass ' Inverse value of mass
    AS SINGLE staticFriction ' Friction when the body has not movement (0 to 1)
    AS SINGLE dynamicFriction ' Friction when the body has movement (0 to 1)
    AS SINGLE restitution ' Restitution coefficient of the body (0 to 1)
    AS _BYTE useGravity ' Apply gravity force to dynamics
    AS _BYTE isGrounded ' Physics grounded on other body state
    AS _BYTE freezeOrient ' Physics rotation constraint
    AS PhysicsShape shape ' Physics body shape information (type, radius, vertices, normals)
END TYPE
```
